# Policy Outline and Consensus
These rules are made to protect people in CollyTown and to ensure that a pleasant atmosphere is retained throughout the County, it is important that everyone agrees to these rules regardless of their roles.

----------
### Disruptive Behaviour
Disruptive behaviour is highly discouraged in CollyTown, you must consider other people's views when talking about a topic or doing something.

**You must follow the ROBLOX's Terms of Service regarding innapropriate behaviour.** CollyTown is not a place for this, you are free to do this in moderation on the CollyTown Discord server(s)

--------
### Crititism
It is highly expected that all members of CollyTown are acceptant towards critique, as it is important to grasp someone elses perspective on whatever is being made.

It is however, highly **unacceptable** to insult members, regardless. Insulting someone prevents any constructive critisism. If you want to deliver a message, please do it responsibly, professionally and in consideration of the other person

-------
### Administration
Moderation is provided in CollyTown to resolve disputes, and to ensure that everything is working in place.
##### Reporting, Requesting a Dispute
Administrators take on the roles of making sure that disputes and issues are resolved, in consideration of both sides regardless of their statusquo towards members. In these events;

* Be expected to answer questions, the moderator will do so to minimise misinterpretation.
* Respect the moderation process, do not proclaim as it is a waste of time.

In a end of a dispute, you must be satisfied that you have closed the dispute in willingness to achieve what you have wanted.

If the moderation process has been abused, or if the dispute is created for silly reasons, the relevant (or both) parties will be dismissed.

---------
### Equality
It is crucial that every member is treated equal, regardless of their hierarchy or authority.

---------
### Two Severity Strike system.
You will be given strike points in regard to your offense, be aware that you can always be given multiple stikes at once if the severity is high. Do not argue towards this process, you are being told to reflect off your offence, and you can remove these strikes if moderators feel that you have reflected off it.

In this order:

Strike One
Strike Two
**Kick**
Strike Three
**Duration Ban**
Strike Four
**Blacklisted**
