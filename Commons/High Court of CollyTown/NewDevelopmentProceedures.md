# CollyTown Version 7.1

As of today, it has been decided that the full recovery of Collytown cannot be done, there were heavy technical issues related to this, assumptions have been made to think that this cannot be done because of the following issues:

* CollyTown is a very large game, with 100k parts
* HTTP Status of the game has been damaged because of a recent abuse, this affected revert history.

Because of this, it is very difficult to model or transfer the workspace into a different server.

----

### Transfer of Previous Creations

Luckily, all progress made on the previous CollyTown can be transfered to the new 7.1 Version of Collytown.

##### Proceedure

A [game](https://www.roblox.com/games/1306227298/Collytown-Inactive-Instance) will be opened containing the old CollyTown map without any PBS functionality. Containing F3X and an enabled HTTPService status, with this you should be able to:

* Use the FeeTrex (F3X) tool to export the model into studio, you will need [this plugin](https://www.roblox.com/library/142485815/Import-from-Building-Tools-by-F3X) on studio to work. The model shouldn't be too large to import using the InsertService provided by ROBLOX.

* Put the code provided by the F3X Tool in-game into the Prompt of the Studio plugin:

* Once that is done, select your import and upload it as a model, **make sure it doesn't contain any viruses!**

* Message the Server Owner about your model, and they should be able to insert the model into the server

### Reflection

Due to the recent malicious occurances on the server, admin powers will heavily be moderated, and the three fold moderation system will be put into place for all users, regardless of whatever circumstances. Preventing repeat offences.

CollyTown Apologises for any inconvienence.
